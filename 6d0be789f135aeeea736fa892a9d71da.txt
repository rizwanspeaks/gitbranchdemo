 once userlogin, server creates one id for that  user and send via response to user browser,, 
then browser saves that id in its own.. then for each click it adds the same id in its further request to setrver

sometimes browser redirect the url what user typed.. i.e broser opens the another site instead of what
user originally typed..which is based on id in broeser
